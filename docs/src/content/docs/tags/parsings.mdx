Parsing blocks interact with the tag invocation and affect the tag's output in Discord.

## Restriction Blocks

The following blocks allow for restriction of tags behind roles or channels, or setting tag
cooldowns.

### Require Block

The require block will attempt to convert the given parameter into a channel or role,
using name or ID. If the user running the tag is not in the targeted channel or doesn't
have the targeted role, the tag will stop processing and it will send the response if
one is given. Multiple role or channel requirements can be given, and should be
split by a `,`.
- **usage:** `{require(<role,channel>):[response]}`
- **aliases:** `whitelist`
- **payload:** response, None
- **parameter:** role, channel

<Code code="
{require(Moderator)}
{require(#general, #bot-cmds):This tag can only be run in #general and #bot-cmds.}
{require(757425366209134764, 668713062186090506, 737961895356792882):You aren't allowed to use this tag.}

### Blacklist Block

The blacklist block will attempt to convert the given parameter into a channel or role,
using name or ID. If the user running the tag is in the targeted channel or has the targeted
role, the tag will stop processing and it will send the response if one is given.
Multiple role or channel requirements can be given, and should be split by a `,`.
- **usage:** `{blacklist(<role,channel>):[response]}`
- **aliases:** None
- **payload:** response, None
- **parameter:** role, channel

<Code code="
{blacklist(Muted)}
{blacklist(#support):This tag is not allowed in #support.}
{blacklist(Tag Blacklist, 668713062186090506):You are blacklisted from using tags.}
" lang="rust" title="example" />

### Cooldown Block

The cooldown block implements cooldowns when running a tag. The parameter requires 2
values to be passed: `rate` and `per` integers. The `rate` is the number of times
the tag can be used every `per` seconds.

The payload requires a `key` value, which is the key used to store the cooldown.
A key should be any string that is unique. If a channel's ID is passed as a key,
the tag's cooldown will be enforced on that channel. Running the tag in a separate
channel would have a different cooldown with the same `rate` and `per` values.

The payload also has an optional `message` value, which is the message to be sent
when the cooldown is exceeded. If no message is passed, the default message will be
sent instead. The cooldown message supports 2 blocks: `key` and `retry_after`.
- **usage:** `{cooldown(<rate>|<per>):<key>|[message]}`
- **aliases:** None
- **payload:** key, message
- **parameter:** rate, per

<Code code="
{cooldown(1|10):{author(id)}}
# the tag author used the tag more than once in 10 seconds
# The bucket for 741074175875088424 has reached its cooldown. Retry in 3.25 seconds.

{cooldown(3|3):{channel(id)}|Slow down! This tag can only be used 3 times per 3 seconds per channel. Try again in **{retry_after}** seconds.}
# the tag was used more than 3 times in 3 seconds in a channel
# Slow down! This tag can only be used 3 times per 3 seconds per channel. Try again in **0.74** seconds.

## Message Block

Message blocks modify the tag's output.

### Embed Block

An embed block will send an embed in the tag response. There are two ways to use
the embed block, either by using properly formatted embed JSON from an embed generator
or manually inputting the accepted embed attributes.

- **JSON**

> Using JSON to create an embed offers complete embed customization.
Multiple embed generators are available online to visualize and generate embed JSON.
> - **usage:** `{embed(<json>)}`
> - **aliases:** None
> - **payload:** None
> - **parameter:** json

<Code code='
{embed({"title":"Hello!", "description":"This is a test embed."})}
{embed({
    "title":"Here is a random duck!",
    "image":{"url":"https://random-d.uk/api/randomimg"},
    "color":15194415
})}
' lang="json" title="example" />

- **Manual**

> The following embed attributes can be set manually -
> - `title`
> - `description`
> - `color`
> - `url`
> - `thumbnail`
> - `image`
> - `footer`
> - `field` - (see below)
> Adding a field to an embed requires the payload to be split by `|`, `;` or `,`
into either 2 or 3 parts. The first part is the name of the field, the second is
the text of the field, and the third optionally specifies whether the field
should be inline.
> - **usage:** `{embed(<attribute>):<value>}`
> - **aliases:** None
> - **payload:** value
> - **parameter:** attribute

<Code code="
{embed(color):#37b2cb}
{embed(title):Rules}
{embed(description):Follow these rules to ensure a good experience in our server!}
{embed(field):Rule 1|Respect everyone you speak to.|false}
{embed(footer):Thanks for reading!|{guild(icon)}}
" lang="json" title="example" />

Both methods can be combined to create an embed in a tag. The following
tagscript uses **JSON** to create an embed with fields and later set the embed title.

<Code code='
{embed(title):my embed title}
{embed({{
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "Field 1",
            "value": "field description",
            "inline": false
        }
    ]
})}
' lang="json" title="example" />

### Redirect Block

Redirects the tag response to either the given channel, the author's DMs, or
uses a reply based on what is passed to the parameter.
- **usage:** `{redirect(<"dm"|"reply"|channel>)}`
- **aliases:** None
- **payload:** None
- **parameter:** `dm`, `reply` or channel

<Code code="
{redirect(dm)}
{redirect(reply)}
{redirect(#general)}
{redirect(626861902521434160)}
" lang="rust" title="example" />

### Delete Block

Delete blocks will delete the invocation message if the given parameter is true.
If there is no parameter i.e. `{delete}` it will default to true.
- **usage:** `{delete([bool])}`
- **aliases:** None
- **payload:** None
- **parameter:** bool, None

<Code code="
{delete}
{delete({args(1)}==delete)}
" lang="rust" title="example" />

### React Block

The react block will react with up to 5 emoji to the tag response message.
If the name used is `reactu`, it will react to the tag invocation instead.
The given emoji can be custom or unicode emoji. Emojis can be split with `,`.

The block accepts emojis being passed to the parameter or the payload, but not both.
- **usage:** `{react(<emoji,emoji>):[emoji,emoji]}`
- **aliases:** `reactu`
- **payload:** emoji
- **parameter:** emoji

<Code code="
{react(🅱️)}
{react(🍎,🍏)}
{react(<:kappa:754146174843355146>)}
{reactu:🅱️}
" lang="rust" title="example" />

## Utility Blocks

The following utility blocks extend the power of tags that interface with bot commands.

### Command Block

Run a command as if the tag invoker had ran it. Only 3 command blocks can be used in a tag.
- **usage:** `{command:<command>}`
- **aliases:** `c`, `com` and `command`
- **payload:** command
- **parameter:** None

<Code code="
{c:ping}
# invokes ping command

{c:ban {target(id)} Chatflood/spam}
# invokes ban command on the pinged user with the reason as 'Chatflood/spam'
" lang="py" title="example" />

### Override Block

Override a command's permission requirements. This can override mod, admin, or general user
permission requirements when running commands with the [Command Block](#command-block).
Passing no parameter will default to overriding all permissions.

In order to add a tag with the override block, the tag author must have `Manage Server`
permissions.

This will not override bot owner commands or command checks.
- **usage:** `{override(["admin"|"mod"|"permissions"]):[command]}`
- **aliases:** None
- **payload:** command
- **parameter:** `admin`, `mod` or `permissions`

<Code code="
{override}
# overrides all commands and permissions

{override(admin)}
# overrides commands that require the admin role

{override(permissions)}
{override(mod)}
# overrides commands that require the mod role or have user permission requirements
" lang="py" title="example" />

### AllowedMentions Block

The `allowedmentions` block attempts to enable mentioning of roles. Passing no parameter
enables mentioning of all roles within the message content. However passing a role name or
ID to the block parameter allows mentioning of that specific role only. Multiple role
name or IDs can be included, separated by a comma `,`. By default, mentioning is only
triggered if the execution author has `Manage Server` permissions. However, using
the `override` keyword as a payload allows mentioning to be triggered by anyone.
- **usage:** `{allowedmentions(<role, None>):["override", None]}`
- **aliases:** `mentions`
- **payload:** `override` or None
- **parameter:** role, None

<Code code="
{allowedmentions}
{allowedmentions:override}
{allowedmentions(@Admin, Moderator):override}
{allowedmentions(763522431151112265, 812949167190048769)}
{mentions(763522431151112265, 812949167190048769):override}
