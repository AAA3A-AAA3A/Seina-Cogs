## Core Blocks

Core pythonic **TagScriptEngine** blocks.

### Assignment Block

Variables are useful for choosing a value and referencing it later in a tag.
Variables can be referenced using blackets as any other block.
- **usage:** `{=(<name>):<value>}`
- **aliases:** `assign`, `let` and `var`
- **payload:** value
- **parameter:** name

<Code code="
{=(prefix):!}
The prefix here is `{prefix}`.
# The prefix here is `!`.

{assign(day):Monday}
{if({day}==Wednesday):It's Wednesday my dudes!|The day is {day}.}
# The day is Monday.
" lang="py" title="example" />

### Random Block

Pick a random item from a list of strings, split by either `~` or `,`.
An optional seed can be provided to the parameter to always choose the same item when
using that seed.
- **usage:** `{random([seed]):<list>}`
- **aliases:** `#` and `rand`
- **pyload:** list
- **parameter:** seed, None

<Code code="
{random:Carl,Harold,Josh} attempts to pick the lock!
# Possible Outputs:
# Josh attempts to pick the lock!
# Carl attempts to pick the lock!
# Harold attempts to pick the lock!

{=(insults):You're so ugly that you went to the salon and it took 3 hours just to get an estimate.~I'll never forget the first time we met, although I'll keep trying.~You look like a before picture.}
{=(insult):{#:{insults}}}
{insult}
# Assigns a random insult to the insult variable
" lang="py" title="example" />

### Math Block <Badge text="Experimental" variant="caution" />

Evaluate mathematical expressions using the Math Block.
- **usage:** `{math:expression}`
- **aliases:** `m`, `+` and `calc`
- **payload:** math expression
- **parameter:** None

### Range Block

The range block picks a random number from a range of numbers seperated by `-`.
The number range is inclusive, so it can pick the starting/ending number as well.
Using the rangef block will pick a number to the tenth decimal place.

An optional seed can be provided to the parameter to always choose the same item
when using that seed.
- **usage:** `{range([seed]):<lowest-highest>}`
- **aliases:** `rangef`
- **payload:** number
- **parameter:** seed, None

<Code code="
Your lucky number is {range:10-30}!
# Your lucky number is 14!
# Your lucky number is 25!

{=(height):{rangef:5-7}}
I am guessing your height is {height}ft.
# I am guessing your height is 5.3ft.
" lang="py" title="example" />

## Control Blocks

Control and do more with your tags using the control blocks.

### If Block

The if block returns a message based on the passed expression to the parameter.
An expression is respresented by two values compare with an operator.

The payload is a required message that must be split by `|`. If the expression
evaluates true, then the message before the `|` is returned, else the message after
is returned.
- **usage:** `{if(<expression>):<message>}`
- **payload:** message
- **parameter:** expression
- **operators:**

<ExpressionOperatorsTable />

<br />

<Code code="
{if({args}==63):You guessed it! The number I was thinking of was 63!|Too {if({args}<63):low|high}, try again.}
# if args is 63
# You guessed it! The number I was thinking of was 63!

# if args is 73
# Too low, try again.

# if args is 14
# Too high, try again.
" lang="py" title="example" />

### Break Block

The break block will force the tag output to only be the payload of this block,
if the passed expresssion evaluates true. If no message is provided to the payload,
the tag output will be empty.

This differs from the `StopBlock` as the stop block stops all tagscript processing
and returns its message while the break block continues to process blocks.
If command blocks exist after the break block, they will still execute.
- **usage:** `{break(<expression>):[message]}`
- **aliases:** `short` and `shortcircuit`
- **payload:** message
- **parameter:** expression

<Code code="{break({args}==):You did not provide any input.}" lang="py" title="example" />

### All Block

The all block checks that all of the passed expressions are true. 
Multiple expressions can be passed to the parameter by splitting them with `|`.

The payload is a required message that must be split by `|`. If the expression evaluates
true, then the message before the `|` is returned, else the message after is returned.
- **usage:** `{all(<expression|expression|...>):<message>}`
- **aliases:** `and`
- **payload:** message
- **parameter:** expression

<Code code="
{all({args}>=100|{args}<=1000):You picked {args}.|You must provide a number between 100 and 1000.}
# if {args} is 52
You must provide a number between 100 and 1000.

# if {args} is 282
You picked 282.
" lang="py" title="example" />

### Fifty-fifty Block

The fifty-fifty block has a 50% change of returning the payload,
and 50% chance of returning null.
- **usage:**  `{50:<message>}`
- **aliases:** `5050` and `?`
- **payload:** message
- **parameter:** None

<Code code="
I pick {if({5050:.}!=):heads|tails}
# I pick heads
" lang="py" title="example" />

### Stop Block

The stop block stops tag processing if the given parameter is true.
If a message is passed to the payload it will return that message.
- **usage:** `{stop(<bool>):[string]}`
- **aliases:** `halt` and `error`
- **payload:** string, None
- **parameter:** bool

<Code code="
{stop({args}==):You must provide arguments for this tag.}
# enforces providing arguments for a tag
" lang="py" title="example" />

## String Blocks

Manipulate strings in tags using the string blocks.

### Replace Block

The replace block will replace specific characters in a string.
The parameter should split by a `,`, containing the characters to find before the
command and the replacements after.
- **usage:** `{replace(<original,new>):<message>}`
- **aliases:** None
- **payload:** message
- **parameter:** original, new

<Code code="
{replace(o,i):welcome to the server}
# welcime ti the server

{replace(1,6):{args}}
# if {args} is 1637812
# 6637862

{replace(, ):Test}
# T e s t
" lang="py" title="example" />

### URLEncode Block

This block will encode a given string into a properly formatted url with non-url
compliant characters replaced. Using `+` as the parameter will replace spaces
with `+` rather than `%20`.
- **usage:** `{urlencode(["+"]):<string>}`
- **aliases:** None
- **payload:** string
- **parameter:** `+`, None

<Code code="
{urlencode:covid-19 sucks}
# covid-19%20sucks

{urlencode(+):im stuck at home writing docs}
# im+stuck+at+home+writing+docs
" lang="py" title="example" />

## Miscellaneous Blocks

Miscellaneous/Utility blocks for tags.

### Strftime Block

The strf block converts and formats timestamps based on
[strftime formatting spec](https://strftime.org/). Two types of timestamps are supported:
ISO and epoch. If a timestamp isn't passed, the current UTC time is used.

Invoking this block with `unix` will return the current Unix timestamp.
- **usage:** `{strf([timestamp]):<format>}`
- **aliases:** `unix`
- **payload:** format, None
- **parameter:** timestamp

<Code code="
{strf:%Y-%m-%d}
# 2021-07-11

{strf({user(timestamp)}):%c}
# Fri Jun 29 21:10:28 2018

{strf(1420070400):%A %d, %B %Y}
# Thursday 01, January 2015

{strf(2019-10-09T01:45:00.805000):%H:%M %d-%B-%Y}
# 01:45 09-October-2019

{unix}
# 1629182008
